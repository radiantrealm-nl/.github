## Our current projects
A quick overview of our running projects.

### Bankconomy
An economyy provider and interface for both Minecraft and the web! Allowing users to initiate transactions, create savings and check their Bankconomy account. An extensive allows fluent user experience, while the mainframe provides a strong and secure environment to work with.

### MyShop
MyShop is an economy shop to allow exchange of goods between players and the server. While the mainframe keeps track of transactions and stocks, players can stash up their Bankconomy account by contributing to the server economy!
