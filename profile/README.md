Hey there, thank you for visiting our organisation!

## Our current projects

### Bankconomy
An economy provider and interface for both Minecraft and the web! Allowing users to initiate transactions, create savings and check their Bankconomy account. An extensive webserver allows fluent user experience, while the mainframe allows a strong and secure environment to work with.

Currently Bankconomy is being actively worked on. It consists of three main Java applications. The mainframe processes transactions, stores user data and logs user actions, while the webserver acts as the glue between the mainframe and frontend, hydrating HTML templates with high efficieny.

The Bankconomy account you join our servers with is based on the UUID of your Minecraft account. Thus the Minecraft server plugin will create your Bankconomy account on first join!

Sidenote: The Minecraft server and Bankconomy applications are still under development! ðŸ¤«

### MyShop
MyShop is an economy shop were players can exchange goods, such as raw materials, minerals and food! It heavily relies on Bankconomy to make transactions, but it also keeps track of it's own item stock.

The setup for MyShop is nearly identical as for Bankconomy. However, in the Minecraft server players can drop-off their goods to sell, while they can buy it online via a web interface.
